# Asking Questions During the ForgeAI Hackathon

Need help, clarification, or encountering a blocker? We're here to help! To keep things organized, ensure your questions reach the mentors efficiently, **and allow everyone to benefit from the answers**, please use **GitHub Issues** within the **dedicated `hackathon-crf/questions-mentor` public repository**.

## Why Use GitHub Issues in the Public Q&A Repo?

*   **Transparency & Shared Learning:** Allows all participants to see questions and learn from the answers given by mentors and other teams.
*   **Centralized Knowledge:** All hackathon-related questions and answers are gathered in one easily searchable place.
*   **Trackable:** Everyone can see the question and its status.
*   **Asynchronous:** Ask your question anytime, and mentors can respond when available.
*   **Focused:** Keeps discussions tied to specific problems or topics.
*   **Visibility:** Helps mentors prioritize and prevents duplicate questions.
*   **Organized Triage:** Linking to the project board ensures your question gets seen by mentors!

## How to Ask a Question (Submit an Issue)

Follow these steps carefully to ensure your question is routed correctly:

1.  **Navigate to the Q&A Repository:**
    *   Go to the **`hackathon-crf/questions-mentor`** repository on `github.com`. *(Use the correct link)*

2.  **Open the Issues Tab:**
    *   Click on the **Issues** tab, usually located near the top of the repository page alongside "Code", "Pull requests", etc.

3.  **Check Existing Issues:**
    *   Before posting, quickly browse or search the existing issues to see if your question has already been asked!

4.  **Create a New Issue:**
    *   If your question is new, click the green **New issue** button on the right side of the Issues page.

5.  **Write a Clear Title:**
    *   Make the title a concise summary of your problem or question.
    *   *Good Examples:* `FastAPI returning 500 error on /api/v1/process`, `How to format history_data for RAG API?`, `Unsure how to add document to RAG collection`
    *   *Bad Examples:* `Help!`, `Code not working`, `Question`

6.  **Write a Detailed Description:**
    *   In the main text box ("Leave a comment"), provide details:
        *   **What are you trying to achieve?** (Your goal)
        *   **What steps did you take?**
        *   **What happened?** (Describe the actual outcome)
        *   **What did you expect to happen?**
        *   **Include relevant code snippets.** Use Markdown code blocks (```python ... ```) for formatting.
        *   **Paste specific error messages.** Use code blocks for these too.
        *   **Mention relevant files or API endpoints** you are working with in your *team's* repository if applicable, but do not paste large amounts of private code here.
    *   See "Tips for Effective Questions" below.

7.  **Link to the Mentors Project (CRITICAL STEP!):**
    *   Look at the **right-hand sidebar** of the "New issue" page.
    *   Find the **Projects** section.
    *   Click the gear icon ⚙️ next to "Projects".
    *   In the dropdown or search box that appears, find and select **`Q&A w/ Mentors`**.
    *   **Ensure this project is checked or added to your issue.** This is how your question gets routed to the mentors' triage board! *If you skip this step, mentors might miss your question.*

8.  **Submit the Issue:**
    *   Once you've filled everything out and **linked the project**, click the green **Submit new issue** button.

## Tips for Effective Questions

To help mentors understand and answer your questions faster:

*   **Be Specific:** Avoid vague questions. Pinpoint the problem area.
*   **Provide Context:** Clearly explain the situation. If the issue relates to code in your *private* team repository, describe the relevant parts without pasting sensitive or proprietary code blocks. Mentors might ask follow-up questions privately if needed.
*   **Show Your Work:** Explain what you've already tried to solve the problem. This prevents suggestions you've already tested.
*   **Use Code Blocks:** Format *short, illustrative* code snippets and error messages using Markdown triple backticks (```) for readability.
*   **Isolate the Problem:** If possible, try to reproduce the issue with the simplest possible code example.

## Important Security Note (❗Very Important for Public Repo❗)

*   **DO NOT** post sensitive information (like your `MISTRAL_API_KEY`, other passwords, personal data, or large blocks of proprietary code from your private team repo) directly in GitHub Issues within this **public Q&A repository**.
*   Assume anything you post here is visible to everyone.
*   If discussion requires sharing sensitive details, a mentor will guide you on how to do that privately.

## Response Times

Mentors will be actively monitoring the **`Q&A w/ Mentors`** project board during scheduled support hours. They will triage and respond to issues as quickly as possible. Please be patient, especially during busy periods. Check the issue for comments and updates.
